# CS-499-Software-Project
This will be my repository for the scanning software project for CS 499

productData.txt and OrderData.txt contain real test data from skybreed. Further modification will be done after presenting the project to utilize API calls to gather and modify data. This will be done afterwords to help protect skybreed by not showing any sensitive information.

WEEK 1 Update --> Met with buisness and got final details over the project / what software I will be using. 

WEEK 2 Update --> Began learning some of the software I will be utilizing for this project, specifically TKinter GUI.
              --> Brainstormed possible workflows to determine best path forward with the buisness.
